## Fixes Applied

### 1 · docker-compose.yml broken paths

Four paths referenced the old flat `api/` structure and did not exist after reorganisation under `repo/backend/`:

| Old | Fixed |
|---|---|
| `context: ./api` | `context: ./backend` |
| `./init.sql` (MySQL volume) | `./backend/database/migrations/init.sql` |
| `cd unit_tests` | `cd backend/unit_tests` |
| `cd API_tests` | `cd backend/API_tests` |

### 2 · README run-tests command

"Run Tests In Docker" section now shows `./run_tests.sh` instead of the raw multi-step docker-compose commands.

### 3 · Validation 400 coverage — finance and property domains

Added two API tests covering validation failure across domains:
- `testFinanceBookkeeping_missingAmount_shouldReturn400` (`@Order(13)`) — `POST /finance/bookkeeping` with missing `amount` → 400
- `testCreateProperty_missingCode_shouldReturn400` (`@Order(14)`) — `POST /api/properties` with missing `code` → 400

Coverage upgraded from "Basic Coverage" (appointment only) to "Sufficient" (three domains).

### 4 · Secondary password missing-header variant

`POST /finance` uses `@RequestHeader("X-Secondary-Password")` (required by default). When the header was absent, the unhandled `MissingRequestHeaderException` fell through to the generic `Exception` handler and returned 500.

Two changes made:
- `GlobalExceptionHandler.java` — added explicit `@ExceptionHandler(MissingRequestHeaderException.class)` returning 400 / code 4004.
- `ApiFunctionalTest.java` — added `testFinanceCreate_missingSecondaryPasswordHeader_shouldReturn400` (`@Order(15)`) asserting 400 when header is omitted.

### 5 · Finance import unit edge cases

Added two unit tests to `TransactionServiceTest.java`:
- `importBookkeepingInvalidRefundableValueCollectsError` — row with `refundable: "yes"` (not `"true"`/`"false"`) is collected as an error row; success count = 0, failure count = 1.
- `importBookkeepingInvalidPayerIdFormatCollectsError` — row with `payerId: "not-a-number"` is collected as an error row; success count = 0, failure count = 1.

## Stale Evidence Paths in Audit Document

The audit was generated against the old flat repo structure. All `api/src/...` references are now at `backend/src/...`. The code exists intact at the current paths — documentation staleness only, no runtime impact.

| Audit path | Actual current path |
|---|---|
| `api/src/main/java/com/anju/...` | `repo/backend/src/main/java/com/anju/...` |
| `API_tests/src/test/java/...` | `repo/backend/API_tests/src/test/java/...` |
| `unit_tests/src/test/java/...` | `repo/backend/unit_tests/src/test/java/...` |
| `init.sql` | `repo/backend/database/migrations/init.sql` |
